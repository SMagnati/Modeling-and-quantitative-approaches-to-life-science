## Modeling the Central Dogma in E. coli: A Systems Biology Approach

## Overview
Welcome to the **Modeling and Quantitative Approaches to Life Science** repository! This project focuses on applying systems biology techniques to model the **Central Dogma of molecular biology in *E. coli***. The model aims to quantitatively describe transcription and translation dynamics, providing insights into gene expression regulation.

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following key files:

- **Magnati_Project_Central_Dogma**: A detailed explanation of the biological model, assumptions, and mathematical formulation.
- **Magnati_Python_Prjct.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook implementing the model using Python, including simulations and visualizations.

## Model Description
The project models the **Central Dogma** by incorporating:
- Transcription: mRNA synthesis rate, degradation dynamics.
- Translation: Protein synthesis rate, degradation mechanisms.
- Regulatory mechanisms affecting gene expression.

This approach allows for computational simulations to explore different biological scenarios and parameter sensitivities.

## Dependencies
To run the code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy jupyter
```

## Running the Model
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Magnati_Python_Prjct.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the model simulations.
3. Modify parameters to explore different biological conditions.

## Contributions
Feel free to fork this repository, submit issues, or open pull requests to improve the model!
